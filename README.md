### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sara, I'm very creative, curious and ambitious and I love solving problems. I'm studying coding at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/). I'm soon done with the first level of my studies and the next step is deepening my coding knowledge with an internship.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- Corewar, a project where the objective is to build a virtual arena where programs, Champions, will fight with each other. You also create an assembler that compiles those Champions as well as your own Champion.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Full stack development with the Helsinki Universtity [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en) course
- Basics of AI with the [Elements of Ai](https://www.elementsofai.com/) courses by Reaktor and the University of Helsinki
